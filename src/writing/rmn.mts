/**
 * writing/rmn — Relational Model Notation as a decidable executable codec.
 *
 * RMN is the JSON s-expression IR for `RelMath.CHL.Tm` — the de-Bruijn STLC with
 * products and unit whose Church-Rosser/confluence property is Lean-certified.
 * The package admits only closed, well-typed core terms at this boundary, then
 * settles them with the package evaluator. That gives the codec a concrete
 * decidable admission gate for executable JSON content. It is deliberately not
 * an arbitrary JavaScript execution boundary, and this package does not currently
 * claim a formal Lean strong-normalization proof for the evaluator's whole
 * domain extension.
 *
 * This is the gauge behind "an HTML document may carry a program and stay
 * decidable": admit `<script type="application/rmn+json">` only when the script
 * body is a closed, well-typed RMN term, and reject every other script type. The
 * document then carries its data, its markup, and its morphism — everything but
 * the interpreter itself.
