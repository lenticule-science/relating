## Entry

### `wireCodec`

```ts
export function wireCodec(name: string): WireCodec
```

Resolve a wire codec by its name.

The wireCodec function is used to retrieve a WireCodec instance by its name,
throwing an error if the name is not recognized. This function serves as a
vocabulary witness, allowing developers to access specific wire codecs, such as
those listed in WIRE_CODEC_NAMES, including jsonCodec, eavtCodec, and rmnCodec,
which are also part of the @emsenn/relating package. It provides a way to
dynamically select a codec based on its name, which can be useful in various
encoding and decoding scenarios.

**Example**

```ts
const myCodec = wireCodec('json');
```
