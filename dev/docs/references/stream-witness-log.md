## Entry

### `streamWitnessLog`

```ts
export function streamWitnessLog(log: readonly EAVTRecord[], lastEventId?: string): string
```

streamWitnessLog projects an EAVT witness log into SSE frames for network
transport.

streamWitnessLog is used when a developer needs to transport the witness ledger
over a network connection, providing a way to resume the stream after a
disconnection by projecting an append-only EAVT witness log into SSE frames,
allowing a client to resume from a specific point in the log. Each row in the
log becomes a single datom event, with its id set to the row's content identity,
maintaining the Scott/CALM property of monotonicity.

**Example**

```ts
const log: readonly EAVTRecord[] = [{ e: 1, a: 2, v: 3, t: 4 }];
const result = streamWitnessLog(log);
```
