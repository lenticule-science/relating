# Wiring: unify the running WireCodec with the graded Projector catalog

**Date:** 2026-06-25
**Status:** landed (2026-06-25) — all three changes shipped; see "Landed" below.
**Touches:** [src/running/codecs.mts](../../src/running/codecs.mts), [src/running/serving.mts](../../src/running/serving.mts), [src/running/http.mts](../../src/running/http.mts)
**Builds on:** the projector gradings (`Corner`/`Rung`, `readIsDecidable`, `admitsTranscode`, `transcode`, `negotiateRepresentation`) and the `rmnProjector` in [src/writing/](../../src/writing/projector.mts); see [dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-rmn-in-html-decidable-documents.md](../docs/notes/2026-06-25-rmn-in-html-decidable-documents.md).

## Why

The `writing/` layer now carries two semantic gradings on every codec — its content
**corner** ⟨addressability, assertivity⟩ (the Belnap bilattice **4**) and its
completion **rung** — with the decidability invariant (`readIsDecidable`), the
admissible-transcode rule (`admitsTranscode`/`transcode`), and corner-aware
negotiation (`negotiateRepresentation`: settle down, never fabricate up).

The `running/` layer does **not** use any of it. It runs an independent, hand-rolled
codec vocabulary that re-implements what the graded `Projector` already provides, and
serves representations without the bilattice asymmetry. Three concrete gaps:

### 1. `WireCodec` is a shadow of `Projector` — derive it, don't duplicate

[running/codecs.mts](../../src/running/codecs.mts) defines
`WireCodec { name, mediaType, decode, encode }` and hand-writes `stringCodec`,
`jsonCodec`, the EAVT wire, etc. Its own header admits the duplication: *"Each codec
is the boundary face of a holography projector."* But `decode`/`encode` re-implement
`Projector.read`/`write`, and the wire carries **no** `corner`/`rung`.

**Change:** derive the wire vocabulary from the `writing` projector catalog. A
`WireCodec` should be a thin view over a `Projector<JsonValue>` — `decode = read`,
`encode = write`, `mediaType` from a corner-tagged table, and `corner`/`rung`
inherited. Then the wire inherits the decidability invariant for free (no wire whose
read is non-monotone/Turing) instead of by accident.

### 2. The serve path hardcodes representations — use `negotiateRepresentation`

[running/serving.mts](../../src/running/serving.mts) exposes `json()` / `html()`
helpers with fixed media types and selects them directly; it never consults the
`Accept` header through the corner-aware negotiator. So a `data`-corner value can be
served as an `assertion` form (fabrication up), which the bilattice forbids.

**Change:** route response selection through `negotiateRepresentation(acceptHeader,
offered, valueCorner)` so the served representation is the best `Accept` match whose
corner does **not exceed** the settled value's. Serve a value down a corner; never
synthesize a richer one.

### 3. Admit `rmnProjector` as a wire — the action body travels

The RMN spec's thesis: *"an action is not an endpoint; an endpoint is one projection
of an action; the action itself is a relation model."* With `rmnProjector` (corner
`assertion`, rung `scott` — total, decidable) now a real codec, an action's **RMN
body can travel as the wire** — inspected, cached, composed, replayed, type-checked —
rather than hiding behind the endpoint.

**Change:** add `application/rmn+json` to the wire vocabulary (via change #1, it comes
along once `rmnProjector` is in the derived catalog) and let `--input-format rmn` /
`Accept: application/rmn+json` select it. A served action may then emit its own total
morphism; a request may carry one. This is the wiring payoff of the closure-hierarchy
work: the four transports (CLI / HTTP / OpenAPI / MCP / web) become projections of one
RMN-bodied action.

## How (sketch)

1. In `running/codecs.mts`, replace the bespoke `WireCodec` constants with a
   `wireOf(projector: Projector<JsonValue>): WireCodec` adapter and a registry built
   from the `writing` catalog (`stringProjector`, `jsonProjector`, `eavtProjector`,
   `rmnProjector`, …). Keep `--input-format`/`--output-format` name selection.
2. Add a media-type → corner step in serving so `negotiateRepresentation` can run; map
   each offered representation through `mediaTypeCorner`.
3. Thread the settled value's corner into the serve path (the action knows its output
   carrier's corner) and negotiate against it.
4. Tests: a `data` value cannot be served as turtle/rmn; an `assertion` value can; an
   RMN-bodied action round-trips through the `application/rmn+json` wire.

## Why not yet (resolved)

These three files (`running/codecs.mts`, `serving.mts`, `http.mts`) were the most
peer-contested in the package and were mid-migration (the typing→writing move) when
this was written. The `running/` refactor has since quiesced, so the scoped pass
landed cleanly — all three changes, capability-preserving.

## Landed (2026-06-25)

All three changes shipped; nothing was deleted or weakened, the count rose:

1. **WireCodec derived from the projector catalog.** `running/codecs.mts` now builds
   every wire through `wireOf(projector, overrides?)`: a `WireCodec` is a thin view
   over a `Projector<JsonValue>` — `decode`/`encode` default to the projector's
   `read`/`write`, `corner`/`rung` are inherited (`cornerOf`/`rungOf`), and the
   decidability invariant is enforced HERE (`wireOf` throws if `!readIsDecidable`, so
   a Turing/non-monotone read can never become a wire). The registry is built from
   the `writing` catalog (`stringProjector`, `jsonProjector`, `eavtProjector`,
   `rmnProjector`) plus a locally-`define`d `formProjector` (the urlencoded form is a
   running-boundary concern with no writing-catalog peer). The `WireCodec` interface
   gained `readonly corner: Corner` and `readonly rung: Rung`. Per-wire byte forms
   are preserved exactly via `overrides` (string canonicalizes a non-string, json
   keeps its trailing newline, eavt normalizes rows). `--input-format`/`--output-format`
   name selection is unchanged. New: `wireByMediaType(mediaType)` (the
   media-type→wire inverse).

2. **Serve path negotiates via `negotiateRepresentation`.** `running/serving.mts`
   threads the `Accept` header into `ServedRequest.accept` (populated by all four
   `serve*` node bindings) and routes output selection through
   `negotiateOutputWire(endpoint, explicitOutName, accept)`: an explicit
   `output-format` wins by name; otherwise `negotiateRepresentation(accept, offered,
   valueCorner(endpoint))` picks the best `Accept` match whose corner does not exceed
   the settled value's. A `data` value is therefore never served as turtle/rmn
   (`assertion`) — fabrication up is forbidden — while an `assertion` value may be
   settled down to json when asked.

3. **`rmnProjector` admitted as a wire.** `application/rmn+json` is now in the wire
   vocabulary (`rmnCodec`, exported); `--input-format rmn` / `Accept:
   application/rmn+json` select it, so an action's total RMN morphism can travel as
   the wire and round-trips (`encode ∘ decode` is the identity on a closed term).

Tests added in `test/acting.test.mjs` (two new `describe` blocks, +7 cases):
wire grading/decidability, the rmn wire admission + round-trip, `wireOf`'s
undecidable-rung rejection, the data-value-can't-fabricate-up negotiation, the
assertion-value-settles-down negotiation, the rmn-bodied HTTP round-trip, and
explicit-format-wins-by-name. Verified: `npm run check` (0 errors), `npm test`
(216/216, up from 209), `npm run build` (exit 0).
